  3.Activities resume from 1pm and must finish in time for a presentation to be delivered by external speaker on â€œStaff    Motivation"
  4.The presentation can start no earlier than 4:00 and no later than 5:00
  5.All activity lengths are either in minutes (not hours) or sprint (15 minutes)
  6.Due to high spirit of the team there needs to be no gap between each activity

digital.away.day/src/main/java/deloitte/digital/away/day/models/Event.java : Event bean with its parameters

digital.away.day/src/main/java/deloitte/digital/away/day/service/EventService.java
	methods : public List<Event> readInputfromResouce(String fileName) throws EventException;
			  public List<List<Event>> organizeEvents(List<Event> eventList, LocalTime startTimeMorning, LocalTime endTimeMorning,
															  LocalTime startTimeEvening, LocalTime endTimeEvening, Integer lunchTime, 
															Integer numberofTeams) throws EventException;
			  public void viewOrganizedList(List<List<Event>> organizedList);
					  
digital.away.day/src/main/java/deloitte/digital/away/day/service/impl/FileEventServiceImpl.java: Class implenting EventService interface : overrides the methods on EventService 

digital.away.day/src/main/java/deloitte/digital/away/exception/EventException.java : Custom exception handler
